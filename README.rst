``frozenset`` is to ``set`` as ``freeze`` is to ``Any``.

That is, ``type(a) is type(b) and a != b`` implies ``freeze(a) != freeze(b)``.

Moreover, this function is deterministic, so it can be used to compare states
**across subsequent process invocations**.

>>> obj = [1, 2, 3, {4, 5, 6}, object()]
>>> hash(obj)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

>>> from charmonium.freeze import freeze
>>> frozen_obj = freeze(obj)
>>> frozen_obj
(1, 2, 3, frozenset({4, 5, 6}), ("<class 'type'>", ('object',)))
>>> hash(frozen_obj) % 1
0

-------------
Special cases
-------------

- ``freeze`` on functions returns their bytecode, constants, and
  closure-vars. This means that ``freeze_state(f) == freeze_state(g)`` implies
  ``f(x) == g(x)``. The remarkable thing is that this is true across subsequent
  invocations of the same process. If the user edits the script and changes the
  function, then it's ``freeze_state`` will change too.

- ``freeze`` on objects returns the objects that would be used by `pickle`_ from
  ``__reduce__``, ``__reduce_ex__``, ``__getnewargs__``, ``__getnewargs_ex__``,
  and ``__getstate__``. The simplest of these to customize your object
  ``__gestate__``. See the `pickle`_ documentation for details.

- In the cases where ``__getstate__`` is already defined for pickle, and this
  definition is not suitable for ``freeze_state``, one may override this with
  ``__getfrozenstate__`` which takes precedence.

Although, this function is not infallible for user-defined types; I will do my
best, but sometimes these laws will be violated. These cases include:

- Cases where ``__eq__`` makes objects equal despite differing attributes or
  inversely make objects inequal despite equal attributes.

   - This can be mitigated if ``__getstate__`` or ``__getfrozenstate__``
